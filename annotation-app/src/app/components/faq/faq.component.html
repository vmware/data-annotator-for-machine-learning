        </clr-accordion-title>
        <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded><span>A&nbsp;:</span>Text annotation projects where a label should be
          selected
          based
          on a text description and any additional attributes. Tabular annotation projects where a label should be
          selected based on a large set of attributes. Image annotation projects where allow you to customise the label
          of the 'Add new label here' input on Labels field. Log annotation projects where allow you to customise the
          label of the 'Add new label here' input on Labels field.</clr-accordion-content>

        <clr-accordion-title><span>Q&nbsp;:</span> What is the size limit for a {{env.config.serviceTitle}} dataset?
        </clr-accordion-title>
        <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded><span>A&nbsp;:</span> Files up to 100MB can be uploaded while creating a
          new project. Files
          up to 500MB can be uploaded through the “My Datasets” tab and used to create a new project. <i
            *ngIf="env.config.authUrl" style="font-style: normal;">If you have
            GB
            size datasets, we can support this through a backend script. Please contact instaml-dev@vmware.com or

        <clr-accordion-title><span>Q&nbsp;:</span> What is the format for downloading annotated data?
        </clr-accordion-title>
        <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded><span>A&nbsp;:</span> Each label type is captured as a new column in the
          export CSV. Each row
          contains the number of annotations for a label type.</clr-accordion-content>

        <clr-accordion-title><span>Q&nbsp;:</span> When will you support more other annotation tasks?
        </clr-accordion-title>
        <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded><span>A&nbsp;:</span> This is on the {{env.config.serviceTitle}} roadmap.

        <clr-accordion-title><span>Q&nbsp;:</span> What is active learning and how is it being used?
        </clr-accordion-title>
        <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded><span>A&nbsp;:</span> Once your project has 50 or more labels,
          {{env.config.serviceTitle}} trains
          an active learning (link to: <a
            href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/active-learning">https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/active-learning</a>
          ) model on this data.
          The resulting model runs predictions on the remaining unlabelled set and returns the most uncertain examples
          for annotators to label. An active learning model continuously queries the "best" and more informative
          examples for annotators to label without duplicating effort. For example, if there are 100 tweets with a sad
          face emoji, the model may learn from just a few examples that a sad face emoji " <clr-icon shape="sad-face"
            class="is-solid" style="color: #EDB200">
          </clr-icon> " in your examples is
          indicative of "negative" sentiment and that it will not benefit from seeing more examples (thus annotators
          will not need to label it). Rather, it will query for other tweets without sad face emojis.
