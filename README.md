Data Annotator for Machine Learning (DAML) is an application that helps machine learning teams facilitating the creation and management of annotations.

Core features include:

- Support for common annotation tasks:
  - Text classification
  - Named entity recognition
  - Tabular classification and regresion
  - Images recognition with bounding boxes and polygons
  - Log labeling
- Active learning with uncertainly sampling to query unlabeled data
- Project tracking with real time data aggregation and review process
- User management panel with role-based access control
- Data management
  - Import in common data formats
  - Export in ML friendly formats
  - Data sharing through community datasets
