3,2014-12-03T12:18:30.000Z,"Hi there, we are after a bit of advice on the best possible route to upgrade vCenter from 5.1 to 5.5.

We currently run VC 5.1 in a separate management cluster protected by vCenter Heartbeat, as VC heartbeat is being deprecated we are looking to not use this. 

We currently use Windows Server 2008R2 and SQL 2008 for the servers, and would like to go to Windows 2012R2 and SQL 2012. 

Would you advise to carry out an in place upgrade on the existing server then look to migrate to a new Windows installation by copying across and restoring the SQL DB? 

Or copy and restore the SQL DB on a new Windows 2012 VC 5.5 install? 

Are key points are not to lose any vSphere historic Metrics or VM registrations. 

We also run the SSO and VC on seperate Windows and SQL installations but only have one vCenter instance. Would the recommendation be to consolidate into one Server?

Thanks
