12/29/2023 3:13:02 PM,@WAALK0TDH: Is NSX automatically configured to use vCenter for auth via WS1 broker when deployed via VCF in 5.1? The docs I've found are pretty lean on this topic.,"@WAATBBNUD: No.  THere is a local WS1 access instance that is configured for that.  <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/vcf-identity-and-access-management-v1/GUID-FF35966D-2225-4825-9E38-C7287B069D4D.html>
,@WAATBBNUD: in addition to this  there is the cross region Ws1 instance for the aria components.
,@WAALK0TDH: Is there a disconnect then with this?  <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/4.1/administration/GUID-E1F27A1E-2E5B-401B-AA07-C1E1A71829C6.html>
,@WAALK0TDH: Specifically how to do  ""For details on how to configure this capability, go to the VMware Cloud Foundation SDDC Manager user documentation at <https://docs.vmware.com>.""
,@WAATBBNUD: well by default we don't deploy ws1 in a default install....this is done manually after bringup.  There is no AD or SSO config done , it is all a post deployment task
,@WAALK0TDH: Right i'm not talking about deploying WS1 access but NSX -> VC SSO via WS1 broker
,@WAATBBNUD: this is as far as i know not configured
,@WAATBBNUD: it COULD be though...nothing preventing it
,@WAALK0TDH: are there docs to tell you how to configure it?
,@WAALK0TDH: seems odd its not in the nsx docs since it should be possible outside of VCF at least prior to all of the recent changes in PnP
,@WAATBBNUD: yeah...i would agree.  i mean it would be purely in the NSX docs if VCF doesnt do it.
,@WAALK0TDH: for reference...idea would be to allow nsx to take advantage of ADFS/Okta/etc identity providers configured in vCenter
,@WAATBBNUD: Yep. Is not configured at all in my teams lab. 
,@WAAGJ1R9A: it’s not yet been picked up as a default of put into the IAM solution. In fact, we’re pulling out the standalone WS1A shortly.
,@WAATBBNUD: With the divest of euc…do we have a strategy as to what will happen with ws1 in general yet Ryan?

4/12/2023 9:45:20 AM,"@WAALGRZEF: Hi Team,
Just had a discussion with my colleague about vCenter Server licensing in a VCF, and I think that the informations reported in the <https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/product/vmware-product-guide.pdf|Product Guide> are not correct.
In particular, at page 63, ""VMware vCenter Server. Customer must separately purchase a _*VMware vCenter Server license for each Workload Domain*_. Licenses to VMware vCenter Server are not included with any VMware Cloud Foundation bundle.""

But in the Public FAQ doc (<https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/datasheet/products/vmware-cloud-foundation-faq.pdf>), Q30 said something different:
""Although part of the platform deployed by VMware Cloud Foundation, vCenter Server is sold and licensed separately. Customers must provide a separate vCenter Server license for a VMware Cloud Foundation environment. _*Only one vCenter Server license is needed per VMware Cloud Foundation instance, regardless of the number of workload domains in the environment*_.""

Could you confirm that the info reported in Product Guide isn't correct?
Thank you very much!
Cheers.","@WAA308AL8: Yes, the product guide is not correct.

You only need to bring one vCenter license to VCF, for the management domain. The rest of the VI WLD vCenters are licensed with an embedded OEM license.
,@WAALGRZEF: <@WAA308AL8> thx for confirming, I'll refer to SDDCPnP Team.
